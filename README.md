# Bake the Cake

A short point-and-click game. Made in a day for my sister's birthday (Feb 19, 2018).

## Design Notes

* Made with CSS + JS because I'm too lazy to learn game frameworks.
* Objects are absolute-positioned divs with image backgrounds.
* Object types and states are denoted by classes.
* Images are drawn with Google Drawings and Gimp,
  with some cliparts from [OpenClipArt](http://openclipart.org/) and images from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org).
* Scaling to fit screen by tweaking the viewport meta. It's hacky and buggy.
